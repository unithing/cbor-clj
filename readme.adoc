Super awesome http://cbor.io/[CBOR] library to be used for Clojure and ClojureScript.

_Currently very much a work in progress._

== Goals

* Native Clojure/ClojureScript
* Fully compatible with the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049[CBOR spec]
* Support for streaming to avoid unnecessary object storage
* Optional features
** Different strictness modes (e.g. definite rather than indefinite lenghts)
** Meta-data report on parsed messages (e.g. size, nesting levels, used types)
** In-flight validation based on (meta) https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl[CDDL]
** Custom tags with associated parsing options
